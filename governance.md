## Proposal Process

The proposal process is as follows:

1. A proposal thread with a temperature check poll is posted on the Discourse (see [this post](https://www.saddle.community/t/about-the-proposals-category/15) for more details)
2. If the poll passes after 72 hours, a formal SIP will be created along with a Snapshot vote.
3. If the Snapshot vote passes, the community multisig will enact the proposal.
