# veSDL (vote escrowed) SDL

## Definitions

* **SDL token** - transferable, used for incentives via emission&#x20;
* **Vote escrow SDL (veSDL)** - non-transferable, locked up by depositing SDL into the voting escrow contract, period from 1 week to 4 years&#x20;
* **Gauge** - the smart contract controlling how much SDL incentives are emitted to each pool; veSDL holders can vote which pool to allocate SDL incentives to on a weekly basis&#x20;
* **User checkpoint** - a user checkpoint in the veSDL mechanism is any time when you interact with veSDL: locking SDL (depositing into a gauge), unlocking SDL (withdrawing from a gauge) or claiming rewards.
